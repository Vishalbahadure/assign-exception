    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the different between ,excptions and syntax errors\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and jumps to a special block of code called an exception handler. Exception handling allows us to gracefully handle these errors and prevent our program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero. Python provides a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions using the try-except block. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block handles the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. Syntax errors are typically caused by typos, missing parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors are detected before the program is executed. Syntax errors need to be fixed before running the program, whereas exceptions can be handled at runtime using exception handling techniques."

    "Q2. What happens when exception is not handle?explain with example\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it results in a program termination and an error message known as an \"unhandled exception.\" This means that the program encounters an error but does not have any code to handle or recover from it. As a result, the program abruptly stops executing, and the error message is displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's consider an example where we attempt to divide a number by zero without handling the ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",

    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a function divide_numbers that takes two numbers as input and divides them. However, when we call this function with num1 = 10 and num2 = 0, a ZeroDivisionError occurs because we are trying to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we haven't implemented any exception handling code, the program terminates and raises an unhandled exception:\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 8, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "As we can see, the program execution stops, and the error message indicates that a ZeroDivisionError occurred due to division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent such abrupt terminations and provide a graceful way to handle errors, it is essential to implement exception handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to catch and handle exceptions appropriately.\n",

    "Q3. which python statement are used to catch and handle exception? explain with example\n",
    "In Python, exception handling is done using the try-except statement. This statement allows you to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code.\n",

    "Q5. what is custom exception in python? why do we need custom exception? explain with example\n",
    "In Python, a custom exception is an exception that is defined by the programmer to handle specific error conditions in their code. While Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions, there are situations where it is necessary to create custom exceptions to handle unique error scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we might need custom exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Error Handling: Custom exceptions allow us to handle specific error conditions that are not covered by the built-in exceptions. By defining our own exceptions, we can provide more meaningful error messages and take appropriate actions based on the specific error scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Organization: Custom exceptions help in organizing code by encapsulating related error conditions. By creating custom exceptions, we can group similar error scenarios together, making the code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Hierarchy: Custom exceptions can be organized in a hierarchy, allowing us to handle errors at different levels. This hierarchy can be useful when we want to catch and handle exceptions at different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of custom exceptions:\n",
    "class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise InvalidInputError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except InvalidInputError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception called InvalidInputError. The divide_numbers function raises this exception when the second argument is zero. By catching the InvalidInputError exception, we can handle the specific error condition and provide a meaningful error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python provide a powerful mechanism to handle specific error scenarios and improve code organization. By defining our own exceptions, we can make our code more robust and easier to maintain."

    "Q6. create custom exception class use this class to handle exception\n",
    "In Python, you can create your own custom exception class by inheriting from the built-in Exception class. This allows you to define your own specific exceptions that can be raised and caught in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom exception class, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a class that inherits from the Exception class. This will make your class an exception type.\n",
    "Optionally, you can add additional attributes or methods to your custom exception class to provide more information or functionality.\n",
